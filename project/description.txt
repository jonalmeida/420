For my project, I want to create a simple text application that will allow you to communicate with people via SMS. The application will use the built-in SMS Provider in Android to pull it all your contacts that you've had a conversation with, and list them. Clicking any one of the contact's names would open a recent history thread of the conversation you were having with that user. The application will also allow you to send messages to that contact.

You would also be able to start new conversation thread with contacts that you do not have a conversation history with.

There will be a basic Settings option to change minor aspects of the application, e.g. color of top bar, etc.

There are two "nice-to-have features" that would like to implement **only** if time permits:
 - When a message is received and the application not active or the phone screen is off, the LED on the phone would flash, a simple notification item would be added to the Notification drawer and the phone should vibrate only when the SMS is first received.
 - I'd like to add an additional feature where the application would have a service part which would show you a dialog/widget when a new SMS is received along with a text field that you let you reply back to that text message.
